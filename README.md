# numpy-digit-classifier
A simple neural network built from scratch using only NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project implements the core building blocks of deep learning  forward pass, backpropagation, gradient descent, and weight updates without completely relying on machine learning frameworks.
